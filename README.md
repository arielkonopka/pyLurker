author: ariel.konopka@gmail.com




Welcome to the pyLurker.
Here you will find a small python3 project that is supposed to be a fully working game.

The game is divided into functional modules, these are:
* board module, 
* graphics griver, 
* level Manager,
* main thread

## board module
This module is responsible for the whole game mechanics.
It contains constants and classes that are needed to make everything moving.
Here you will be able to find routines that are responsible for all the objects movements

## graphics driver
This module is responsible for drawing all the elements, it contains the skin manager class, 
which reads skin definition file, and let's you choose the skin avaialble in the system.
It utilizes the skin information to draw objects on the screen.

## level manager
This module contains code that loads the levels from the level files.


## main thread
This is the control over the game process, stuff like exiting program should be done here.
